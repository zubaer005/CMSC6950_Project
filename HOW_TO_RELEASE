1. Increase release version in ``setup.py`` file

1. Update date and release version in https://github.com/euroargodev/argopy/blob/master/docs/whats-new.rst

1. On the master branch, commit the release in git:

      ```git commit -a -m 'Release v0.X.Y'```

1. Tag the release:

      ```git tag -a v0.X.Y -m 'v0.X.Y'```

1. Push it online:

      ```git push origin v0.X.Y```

1. Issue the release on GitHub. Click on "Draft a new release" at
    https://github.com/euroargodev/argopy/releases. Type in the version number, but
    don't bother to describe it -- we maintain that on the docs instead.
    
    This will trigger the publish Github action that will push the release on Pypi.     

1. Create a branch with this release code for legacy.
    
      ```git checkout tags/v0.X.Y -b v0.X.Y-branch```
