\section{Introduction}


\section{Conclusions}

In conclusion, two computational tasks were performed using data extracted from the argopy Python library. The first computational task provided a visualization of total Argo float numbers through time using the pandas, matplotlib and geopandas Python libraries. The second computational task consisted of extracting data from two Argo floats using argopy. The trajectory and temperature variation with time was then visualized by also using the pandas, matplotlib and geopandas Python libraries.
